# Real Estate Idea

## 1. Objective
* Empower home buyers and sellers to do the following from, all from their phones:

  * Put their house on the market; with the ability to negotiate offers, manage the process, and track the progress.

  * Locate the home, schedule showings, submit an offer, manage the process, and track progress.

## 2. Users (User Story)

#### Sellers:
As Jim and Sally, I want to sell my house quickly, easily, and for the most money, so that I have more money for the next one and the life interruption is minimized.

#### Buyers:
As Jim and Sally, I want to find my house, own/control the process, and get help when I want it.

#### A Little More Detail:
Jim and Sally are expecting their first child and need more space for their growing family.  After being unimpressed with real estate agents promising to put a sign in their yard (and not much more), they pulled up the [project name]: within 5 minutes they had the professional photographer, expert stager, and appraiser scheduled to come out two days later.  Within a week, their house was on the market, priced using market data, with a description written by a professional copy-writer.  All of this for a fraction of the traditional 4%-6% fee that's paid to agents.

As Jim and Sally managed the showings and fielded offers from their phones, they also went house hunting. After looking at a few homes, they found the right one.  Pulling up [project name], they quickly wrote an offer. The sellers accepted, and Jim and Sally moved into their new home, ready for baby.


## 3. The Problem Being Solved
Buying and selling a home is expensive and the experience varies widely.  Interviewing Realtors is no assurance of a good experience, regardless of how high or low their fee is.  This can be solved by putting the power and process in the hands of the buyers/sellers via public information, a standardized system they can manage from their phones, and a flat fee with clear expectations.  You can buy literally anything from your phone (including your car with Cavana); you should be able to buy and sell your home from your phone.
