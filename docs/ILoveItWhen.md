## 1. Objective
Provide a place for people to journal their gratitude in an easily accessible and shareable way.

## 2. Users (User Story)

#### Taylor
As Taylor, I want a place to store my most cherished memories, so that I can revisit and share them whenever I want to.

#### A Little More Detail:

Taylor just got back from an amazing date with her husband.  While she likes to jot down things she loves, journaling has always been a challenge.  Instead, she logs on ILoveItWhen.me and simply completes the prompt presented to her: "I love it when ________."

Hey eye catches something she had written a few days ago, displayed on the screen background.  There are other thins as well, all things that she loves.  Things like:
* "I love it when *my kids hug me when they get home from school*"
* "I love it when *our friends get together for game night*"
* "I love it when *I volunteer *at the pet shelter*"
* "I love it when *the leaves turn colors in the fall*"

After being lost in thought about those good experiences, she finally fills in the blank with what brought her there in the first place: "I love it when *my husband takes me out on a well-planned date.*"

This is added to the screen background, where she'll be reminded about the positive experience the next time she logs in.

## 3. The Problem Being Solved
Journaling is commonly accepted as being a positive activity, but it's difficult to get into the habit, especially when you're not sure what to write.  This positive journal makes it easy to practice gratitude, and look back on all the things we have to be thankful for in life.
